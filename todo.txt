Features to implement:
- Matrices - at least mat4, for 3d graphics purposes.
- Custom allocators:
    +-> Chunk allocator
    +-> Linear allocator (Arena)
- Platform layers to handle windowing, colored text, socket programming, etc.
- Graphics API abstractions: Software renderer, OpenGL, Vulkan.
- Fixed point numbers.
- Strings as structures with char* and size.
- Dynamic arrays
    +-> arena + similar to strs above?
    +-> chunker and have it grow up to a limit with no change needed?
- For things like dynamic arrays, template macros for quicly implementing
  complex types with different subtypes - bring out of macro form when debugging
  actual implementation using -E flag.
- Metaprogramming - think about, not use necessarily - or maybe provide an
  interface to use it for other projects. Article on how to implement something
